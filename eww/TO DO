1) make a script for toggling menu 
2) solution to hide empty workspaces buttons 
3) reorganize code in eww.yuck to make ricing easer 
the structure:
- event box (:class ~)
- box (:class ~)
so on
.[box_class] {
	min-width: ~;
}
(mb I have to do something like this with eww.scss 'cause I cannot even read the code)
4) Ricing base elements:
- workspaces buttons size 
- clock button size
- menu button wifi icon indent
5) Mb I can replace font icons with svg icons.
